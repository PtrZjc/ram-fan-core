# Rick and Morty fan tool - core
### Introduction  
The intention of this tool is to use the free public Rick and Morty api and enable user tracking his favourite characters and locations from the series. 
### Planned core capabilities
The backend will use the data captured from free [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) and enable user to make more complicated queries regarding the various things ocurring in the series..
The backend will have exposed REST API to be used by *Rick and Morty fan tool - page*, which I plan to develop while learning Angular.
### Technologies to be used:
The backend will use Postgres along with JOOQ to handle complex user queries. The schema migration will be handled by liquibase.
